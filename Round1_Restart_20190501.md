# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## **Restart for May Day with large group of Flatiron Students**

### Day 1:  5/1/2019 Wednesday
Back again for Round 1 Restart for 100 Days Of Code! Today was Ruby code challenges with biweekly practice group && reviewing Nokogiri web scraping.  Thx to Martin Snyder for great Q&A about careers in tech! @FlatironSchool 

### Day 2: 5/2/2019 Thursday
Work on Github proficiency. Troubleshooting *surprise* black screen on old, workhorse laptop. Also upgrades, tweaks, getting acquainted with Win 10 on new one. Kind of a TBT to my days working in IT to pay the bills while in grad school! 

### Day 3: 5/3/2019 Friday
Day 3:  Setting up a local development environment for first time:  #WSL #Ubuntu #vscode  #Ruby #rubyonrails  to start!  Fun. Big process. Grateful for amazing guide by @MicahShute. Really turned out to be IT week for me!

### Day 4: 5/4/2019 Saturday
A belated log report for Saturday. Session 2 of local dev environment installs on new laptop. A longer process than I realized. In midst of busy weekend of parenting. So as I fit in these installs, I'm taking time to watch the install logs and track progress. Also saving entire terminal log of the process as a backtrace in case there are functional problems as I use the new tools. Can try to figure out what's wrong from backtrace. I installed Ubuntu 16.10 and 18.04 without realizing it. Not sure if this will cause problems. Micah's install guide said NOT to install those versions, and I'm really curious why!

### Day 5: 5/5/2019 Sunday
Session 3 of local dev environment setup. Taking it slow. Pause often to read up on new concepts along the way.
