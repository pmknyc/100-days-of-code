# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## **Restart for May Day with large group of Flatiron Students**

### Day 1:  5/1/2019 Wednesday
Back again for Round 1 Restart for 100 Days Of Code! Today was Ruby code challenges with biweekly practice group && reviewing Nokogiri web scraping.  Thx to Martin Snyder for great Q&A about careers in tech! @FlatironSchool 

### Day 2: 5/2/2019 Thursday
Work on Github proficiency. Troubleshooting *surprise* black screen on old, workhorse laptop. Also upgrades, tweaks, getting acquainted with Win 10 on new one. Kind of a TBT to my days working in IT to pay the bills while in grad school! 

### Day 3: 5/3/2019 Friday
Day 3:  Setting up a local development environment for first time:  #WSL #Ubuntu #vscode  #Ruby #rubyonrails  to start!  Fun. Big process. Grateful for amazing guide by @MicahShute. Really turned out to be IT week for me!

### Day 4: 5/4/2019 Saturday
A belated log report for Saturday. Session 2 of local dev environment installs on new laptop. A longer process than I realized. In midst of busy weekend of parenting. So as I fit in these installs, I'm taking time to watch the install logs and track progress. Also saving entire terminal log of the process as a backtrace in case there are functional problems as I use the new tools. Can try to figure out what's wrong from backtrace. I installed Ubuntu 16.10 and 18.04 without realizing it. Not sure if this will cause problems. Micah's install guide said NOT to install those versions, and I'm really curious why!

### Day 5: 5/5/2019 Sunday
Session 3 of local dev environment setup. Taking it slow. Pause often to read up on new concepts along the way.

### Day 6: 5/6/19 Monday
Yay!! Finished setting up my local Dev environment. Took several sessions and finally a little help from 
Micah Shute (who set up installation guide I'm using) who spotted an extra space character in a config file that's key for authenticating to the bootcamp curriculum online.

### Day 7: 5/7/19 Tuesday
same report as Day 6:

### Day 8: 5/8/19 Wednesday
Code challenges solo & with other students in our semi-weekly "interview practice" group. 

### Day 9: 5/9/19 Thursday
Today was less coding, more time studying Git/Github and Nokogiri scraping.  

### Day 10: 5/10/19 Friday
Practiced opening and working in prior lessons' code to get more accustomed to and troubleshoot working with new computer and local dev environment. Learning that the local environment is a living thing -- needs ongoing care and feeding (installing new gems/libraries as needed for new projects)!! Also completed a lab exercise on scraping with Nokogiri.

### Day 11: 5/11/19 Saturday
Worked on a web scraping lesson using Ruby and gem Nokogiri. I'm finding that sometimes I understand conceptually a process, such as scraping in this case, and I see what the gem is producing as output. The trick for me is to connect the documentation about using Nokogiri, the demos in lessons I've got to work with and the output from my own trial and error with the code. I'm finding Nokogiri to be especially tricky in those respects as compared with other aspects of Ruby I'm using.

### Day 12: 5/12/19 Sunday 
Mother's Day. Took day off coding for some me time and time with family.

### Day 13: 5/13/19 Monday
Code challenges with Mohammad Adeel in our semi-weekly "interview practice" group. We worked on challenging codewars kata level 6. It's aim is to make a mini "linter" method to check for balanced/matching brackets/parentheses/braces. We attempted it mostly without looking for help on Internet. We're meeting later this week, after time to research options, to finish it. 

### Day 14: 5/14/19 Tuesday
Reviewing an old lab and lessons on Class variables and methods. Thought it would help with code for using Nokogiri scraping as part of a CLI application.

### Day 15: 5/15/19 Wednesday
Attended Code Talk study group led by Beth U. We worked on a Codewars challenge as a group.

### Day 16: 5/16/19 Thursday
A few hours of conference-call based training for new remote job working with BETAH Associates in Rockville, MD. I'll be facilitating federal grant applications peer review consensus meetings. Not much time for coding work but did host a late evening session of Code Talk student study group. I didn't line up a guest speaker tonight; worked on Codewars code challenge as a group.

### Day 21: 5/21/19 Tuesday
Traveling to DC area for job training. No coding today so listened to coding podcasts in car. Enjoying The Complete Developer by 2 developers in Nashville, TN. One is a veteran developer, the other relatively new to coding after going to medical school. I relate to their Southern way of turning a phrase and viewing the world. Also enjoy some episodes of "Learn to code with me" podcast by Laurence Bradford.

### Day 22: 5/22/19 Wednesday
Full day of job training. Exhausting day so took day off from coding. Driving home tomorrow.

### Day 23: 5/23/19 Thursday
Another long day of traveling home and still enjoying listening to podcasts. Also joined the Code Talk Flatiron student study group by phone while driving.

### Day 25: 5/25/19 Saturday
Attended Code Talk student study group. Great discusson on using pseudocode led by fellow student Mohammad Adeel.

### Day 30: 5/30/19 Thursday  
Finished the "Student Scraper Lab" in curriculum today. Woo hoo! I really get the concept of scraping and could see the CSS selectors I was trying to grab, yet it was really tricky figuring out syntax needed to get Nokogiri to work its magic!

### Day 42: 6/11/19 Tuesday
Had fun today helping a fellow student. She posted on Slack asking for help resetting her *forgotten* Linux (Ubuntu) password. She's running Linux as a virtual machine in a Win 10 OS via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). I found what looked like a good blog post to help and sent link. She hit a snag so we did a Zoom meeting to screenshare and troubleshoot it. The key was helping her understand that the fix's steps included commands, first, at the Windows command prompt (not within WSL) to edit an Ubuntu configuration setting. Then she had to enter Ubuntu to actually change her Linux user password.

### Day 43: 6/12/19 Wednesday
Working recently on review and learning more about using Git/Github. Today, worked on a lab in curriculum; also practiced making a branch and pushing code to it using a repo shared with a study group I attend. Appeared, in the code backtrace, that the push to a new branch worked but didn't, so will try to find someone to troubleshoot with me. Also attended our regular Interview Practice Group; we did a Codewars challenge together as a group, instead of one person in "hot seat" coding solo with others observing.

### Day 44: 6/13/19 Thursday
Follow up on code challenge with friends last night: We used Ruby #unshift method. I tend to forget on which end of array the #shift versus #unshift methods operate due to their names.  Reading today through Array methods in ruby-doc.org, happily finding that they have aliases that make intuitive sense to me:  #push == #append (add to end of array) and #unshift == #prepend (add to front of array

Working on updated Flatiron lessons on Git/Github. More thorough info in the lessons (yay!) and learning to work with Git in my new-ish local dev environment. Understanding the system a bit better - woo hoo! Fun playing around with a simple repo in local and remote environment, pushing code to remote.

### Day 45: 6/14/19 Friday
The bootcamp curriculum I'm taking had a version upgrade recently, so I'm redoing those section. Working now on new lesson material on Git & Github. It's great to go over Git again, as I'm understaning the system much better. Good version upgrade, Flatiron!

### Day 46: 6/15/19 Saturday
Today I did lessons on introductory HTML. It's great the curriculum upgrade included the HTML and CSS sections. These are so important, as I never learned HTML & CSS in all the IT work I've done.
