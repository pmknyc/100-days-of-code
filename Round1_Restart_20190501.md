# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## **Restart for May Day with large group of Flatiron Students**

### Day 1:  5/1/2019 Wednesday
Back again for Round 1 Restart for 100 Days Of Code! Today was Ruby code challenges with biweekly practice group && reviewing Nokogiri web scraping.  Thx to Martin Snyder for great Q&A about careers in tech! @FlatironSchool 

### Day 2: 5/2/2019 Thursday
Work on Github proficiency. Troubleshooting *surprise* black screen on old, workhorse laptop. Also upgrades, tweaks, getting acquainted with Win 10 on new one. Kind of a TBT to my days working in IT to pay the bills while in grad school! 

### Day 3: 5/3/2019 Friday
Day 3:  Setting up a local development environment for first time:  #WSL #Ubuntu #vscode  #Ruby #rubyonrails  to start!  Fun. Big process. Grateful for amazing guide by @MicahShute. Really turned out to be IT week for me!

### Day 4: 5/4/2019 Saturday
A belated log report for Saturday. Session 2 of local dev environment installs on new laptop. A longer process than I realized. In midst of busy weekend of parenting. So as I fit in these installs, I'm taking time to watch the install logs and track progress. Also saving entire terminal log of the process as a backtrace in case there are functional problems as I use the new tools. Can try to figure out what's wrong from backtrace. I installed Ubuntu 16.10 and 18.04 without realizing it. Not sure if this will cause problems. Micah's install guide said NOT to install those versions, and I'm really curious why!

### Day 5: 5/5/2019 Sunday
Session 3 of local dev environment setup. Taking it slow. Pause often to read up on new concepts along the way.

### Day 6: 5/6/19 Monday
Yay!! Finished setting up my local Dev environment. Took several sessions and finally a little help from 
Micah Shute (who set up installation guide I'm using) who spotted an extra space character in a config file that's key for authenticating to the bootcamp curriculum online.

### Day 7: 5/7/19 Tuesday
same report as Day 6:

### Day 8: 5/8/19 Wednesday
Code challenges solo & with other students in our semi-weekly "interview practice" group. 

### Day 9: 5/9/19 Thursday
Today was less coding, more time studying Git/Github and Nokogiri scraping.  

### Day 10: 5/10/19 Friday
Practiced opening and working in prior lessons' code to get more accustomed to and troubleshoot working with new computer and local dev environment. Learning that the local environment is a living thing -- needs ongoing care and feeding (installing new gems/libraries as needed for new projects) !!

### Day 11: 5/11/19 Saturday
Worked on a web scraping lesson using Ruby and gem Nokogiri. I'm finding that sometimes I understand conceptually a process, such as scraping in this case, and I see what the gem is producing as output. The trick for me is to connect the documentation about using Nokogiri, the demos in lessons I've got to work with and the output from my own trial and error with the code. I'm finding Nokogiri to be especially tricky in those respects as compared with other aspects of Ruby I'm using.

### Day 12: 5/12/19 Sunday 


### Day 13: 5/13/19 Monday
Code challenges with Mohammad Adeel in our semi-weekly "interview practice" group. We worked on challenging codewars kata level 6. It's aim is to make a mini "linter" method to check for balanced/matching brackets/parentheses/braces. We attempted it mostly without looking for help on Internet. We're meeting later this week, after time to research options, to finish it.
