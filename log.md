# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**:1/3/19  First day of first time doing #100daysofCode! Flatiron School student in midst of online web development bootcamp curriculum. Today: First lessons on using Ruby gems and coding Gemfile. Also worked on code challenges with other Flatiron students @ codewars.com. 

**Thoughts:** Paired/group coding today reminded me I need more practice using Ruby array methods to creatively solve problems! Got more familiar with these array methods: #max_by, #detect. Excited to begin exploring all the Ruby gems available and how to use them effectively.
