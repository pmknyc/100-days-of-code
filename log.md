# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: First day of first time doing #100daysofCode! Flatiron School student in midst of online web development bootcamp curriculum. Today: First lessons on using Ruby gems and coding Gemfile. Also worked on code challenges with other Flatiron students @ codewars.com. 

**Thoughts:** Paired/group coding today reminded me I need more practice using Ruby array methods to creatively solve problems! Got more familiar with these array methods: #max_by, #detect. Excited to begin exploring all the Ruby gems available and how to use them effectively.

### Day 2: Friday, January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Lessons on website scraping using Nokogiri gem for Ruby. This weekend will start coding my CLI apps projects for @FlatironSchool curriculum. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** This is just an introduction to scraping. Really interesting tool but need more work with it. I'm searching for websites I could use for upcoming CLI app project. 


### Day 3: Saturday, January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Another Flatiron School lesson/lab on Nokogiri scraping. 

**Thoughts:** I get the concept and general patterns. I have little experience with HTML and CSS, so I see that makes it more challenging to see which tags to call in the Nokogiri code.

### Day 4: Sunday, January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked 1/2 hour on code challenges; attended group code challenge with other @FlatironSchool students. 

**Thoughts:** 
Feel that today I landed below the 100days bar. Will add focused coding time Monday to make up for today. 


### Day 5: Monday, January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Reviewed and practiced Ruby Array methods with easy prefab code challenges & playing around with my own code. 

**Thoughts:** 
Doing code challenges recently with other students helped me realize I need better, faster fluency with methods in my fingertips, not only in my head! So I took a step back from lessons and project prep to practice familiar and new methods.


### Day 6: Tuesday, January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a bootcamp-assigned Music Library CLI app by doing a quick read of project specs and pasting in relevant code from earlier, related assignments to set up the general file structure for the app.

**Thoughts:** 
Feeling excited about this! Since this is building on code I wrote for prior labs, it's a confidence-building beginning to ramp up to an independent CLI project soon. I continue to make progress! Current evidence is that it's ever easier to read and understand project descriptions and RSpec tests. Nice!


### Day 7: Wednesday, January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Attended instructional webinar to prep for the final project of this section of the bootcamp curriculum: design and code a CLI application using object-oriented Ruby. Also worked on Music Library CLI app mentioned yesterday. Read the requirements more in-depth, then made a handwritten project flow diagram of the models, object relationships and methods for the app.

**Thoughts:** 
Mapping the project with paper & pencil is really helpful! I know this, but often skip the step and dive right into coding. Now that I'm getting into more complex code and writing a full app, it will be necessary to plan before coding! Today was good reminder that taking time to draw the project flow and write pseudocode for methods is not only fun but will improve the process and final product!


### Day 8: Thursday, January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Coded basic methods for 3 main Classes in Music Library CLI app! 

**Thoughts:** 
I got through this in less than an hour, which is fast for me! My take-home is that I'm understanding better the object oriented concepts! I've worked kind of slowly so far in curriculum because object oriented coding is so new to me. in past I've worked in SPSS or SAS stats software coding data dictionaries, computing  variables, etc. but never with object orientation.

### Day 9: Friday, January 11, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Working on how to  use **optional** arguments to an #initialize method for a Ruby Class in my Music library CLI project lab. Fun reading blogs and documentation. Alas, my code still triggering the fail **option** in RSpec tests. Sleep **option** now.  Try again tomorrow.

**Thoughts:**
I like to figure things out myself, but I have a goal to be more agile about knowing when to ask peers or instructors for help. I tend to work too long looking up answers or trying code variations with diminishing returns.  

### Day 10: Saturday, January 12, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Started coding day by asking for help where stuck in Music Library CLI project. Over that hump, I easily completed a couple more sections of the project! Requesting help at the right times an important component of effective coding!

**Thoughts:** 
I knew it was a small issue to resolve but am needing lots of practice to find the sweet spot of knowing when to ask for help. Sometimes it's great to decide to stick with something until I get the tests to pass, then ask to review the code with someone and possibly refactor. Many times, though, working through a "stuck"  with someone is efficient, satisfying, and -- BONUS -- builds avenues into ongoing professional relationships in which I can  contribute and receive knowledge and support in future!  Win - win - win!

### Day 11: Sunday, January 13, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Had a great time today doing some a group code challenge with fellow Flatiron School bootcamp students, with adept guidance by a tech coach. We worked on an assignment to build a Ruby tic tac toe CLI app that includes an AI component, i.e. the code includes strategy so that the computer can act as one or both players. Today we focused on writing pseudocode to lay out strategy and rough idea of methods and data structures to use.

**Thoughts:** 
Coding with others is such a distinct experience from working solo. So many opportunities to learn about oneself, as well as learn new ways to approach a coding task, new features of the language (Ruby in this case) or creative ways to apply them. I also was inclined to think of today as being less productive as compared with a similar hour of churning out code. But I pulled back from that comparison. Paired/group coding work is qualitatively different but a worthwhile use of time!

### Day 16: Friday, January 18, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: 
Took day off from coding to do lots of errands. I'll add more time tomorrow and another day to my commitment. Did some useful thought work on my projects while running around all over today. 

**Thoughts:** 
I am still working out best strategy for taking breaks from coding both short and long breaks. In retrospect on today's day off break, it helped clear my head and return to the coding work refreshed. On the other hand, at this early stage of learning to code, some practice every day is a better strategy for retaining the skill. Definitely need some days with very different types of "work" to do.

### Day 17: Saturday, January 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Another great Saturday group coding session with a fellow student and tech coach. We worked on designing AI logic to teach the computer to play Tic Tac Toe as an alternative way to play the game in a Ruby CLI application. 

**Thoughts:** 
TTT game is a great teaching tool for beginning coders. It's an "easy" game to play, and most everyone has played it hundreds of times. But then when you try specify the logic of all steps in playing the game, AND add a game strategy so the computer can play, you realize the complexity. It makes me appreciate not only what's involved in coding but also the amazing cognitive abilities humans have that we can easily take for granted.

### Day 21: Wednesday, January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Working today with other Flatiron School student on fun, challenging lab project building a music library. Mostly I asked Socratic type questions to help her debug a few errors. This is a CLI project using Ruby classes and modules, with several "has many, through" type collaborations among the classes.

**Thoughts:** 
First session working together can be a challenge but it went well and was great learning opportunity for me. She is catching up to me in the lab so we can finish last series of criteria & RSpec tests together. Today we walked through a couple of sections together.  She was grateful for someone to "ask the right questions" and the process helped me  solidify my knowledge & confidence!   I'm getting much better feel of the key code patterns used to create collaborating objects!

### Day 22 : Thursday, January 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
I started work on a Ruby object oriented version of a tic tac toe app, a lab in Flatiron School's full stack web dev program. Earlier in curriculum, we wrote a Ruby CLI app to play tic tac toe. I'm starting with that prior procedural code and revising it for this new approach. 

**Thoughts:** 
I admit my intent was to give myself a jump start by using the old code. The surprising benefit is that trnasforming the code from a procedural to OO approach feels like an organic transformation process in my mind. It's helping me see and feel -- in an almost somatic, sensory way -- more clearly how the OO relationships work. Acquiring that "feel" for the OO patterns and how they work is crucial, so this chance to transition a set of code seems an interesting way to make progress on that "feeling".

**Today's Progress**: 
Working with a coding buddy on our music library CLI project. We've worked together in tandem, as well as individual work that we then shared with each other, with both of us taking the lead at times. 

**Thoughts:** 
This work has been my most extended paired work to date, with a larger project involved. Other experiences have been working on smaller scope code challenges. It's fun and challenging to negotiate, implicitly or explicitly, a comfortable working relationship for paired work. Very grateful that my partner on this project was easygoing, patient with my tendency to think out loud and, I think, be more directive in approach than she tends to be. Also grateful that we tag teamed the workload amiably and she helped me get through "stuck" places when I most needed that! 

### Day 37: Friday, February 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Searching for a good data source to create a CLI application to look up Spanish verb conjugations. Found a great data base by a professor at Indiana-Purdue University in Fort Wayne.

**Thoughts:** 
One aim of this bootcamp CLI project is to learn web scraping using Ruby's Nokogiri gem. It's important to find a site with mostly HTML/CSS data, not a lot of Javascript, as well as a public access policy on using the site's data. This work on a "low tech" command line interface app is a great reminder that there is a vast wealth of resources on the Internet that have not been upgraded to the latest web development technology. Grateful for Prof. Fred Jehle for lovingly creating this rich Spanish data set for his students and making it available for non-commercial use!
