# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: First day of first time doing #100daysofCode! Flatiron School student in midst of online web development bootcamp curriculum. Today: First lessons on using Ruby gems and coding Gemfile. Also worked on code challenges with other Flatiron students @ codewars.com. 

**Thoughts:** Paired/group coding today reminded me I need more practice using Ruby array methods to creatively solve problems! Got more familiar with these array methods: #max_by, #detect. Excited to begin exploring all the Ruby gems available and how to use them effectively.

### Day 2: January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Lessons on website scraping using Nokogiri gem for Ruby. This weekend will start coding my CLI apps projects for @FlatironSchool curriculum. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** This is just an introduction to scraping. Really interesting tool but need more work with it. I'm searching for websites I could use for upcoming CLI app project. 

### Day 3: January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Another Flatiron School lesson/lab on Nokogiri scraping. 

**Thoughts:** I get the concept and general patterns. I have little experience with HTML and CSS, so I see that makes it more challenging to see which tags to call in the Nokogiri code.
