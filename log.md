# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Thursday, January 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: First day of first time doing #100daysofCode! Flatiron School student in midst of online web development bootcamp curriculum. Today: First lessons on using Ruby gems and coding Gemfile. Also worked on code challenges with other Flatiron students @ codewars.com. 

**Thoughts:** Paired/group coding today reminded me I need more practice using Ruby array methods to creatively solve problems! Got more familiar with these array methods: #max_by, #detect. Excited to begin exploring all the Ruby gems available and how to use them effectively.

### Day 2: Friday, January 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Lessons on website scraping using Nokogiri gem for Ruby. This weekend will start coding my CLI apps projects for @FlatironSchool curriculum. #100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts:** This is just an introduction to scraping. Really interesting tool but need more work with it. I'm searching for websites I could use for upcoming CLI app project. 


### Day 3: Saturday, January 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**:  Another Flatiron School lesson/lab on Nokogiri scraping. 

**Thoughts:** I get the concept and general patterns. I have little experience with HTML and CSS, so I see that makes it more challenging to see which tags to call in the Nokogiri code.

### Day 4: Sunday, January 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Worked 1/2 hour on code challenges; attended group code challenge with other @FlatironSchool students. 

**Thoughts:** 
Feel that today I landed below the 100days bar. Will add focused coding time Monday to make up for today. 


### Day 5: Monday, January 7, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Reviewed and practiced Ruby Array methods with easy prefab code challenges & playing around with my own code. 

**Thoughts:** 
Doing code challenges recently with other students helped me realize I need better, faster fluency with methods in my fingertips, not only in my head! So I took a step back from lessons and project prep to practice familiar and new methods.


### Day 6: Tuesday, January 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Started a bootcamp-assigned Music Library CLI app by doing a quick read of project specs and pasting in relevant code from earlier, related assignments to set up the general file structure for the app.

**Thoughts:** 
Feeling excited about this! Since this is building on code I wrote for prior labs, it's a confidence-building beginning to ramp up to an independent CLI project soon. I continue to make progress! Current evidence is that it's ever easier to read and understand project descriptions and RSpec tests. Nice!


### Day 7: Wednesday, January 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Attended instructional webinar to prep for the final project of this section of the bootcamp curriculum: design and code a CLI application using object-oriented Ruby. Also worked on Music Library CLI app mentioned yesterday. Read the requirements more in-depth, then made a handwritten project flow diagram of the models, object relationships and methods for the app.

**Thoughts:** 
Mapping the project with paper & pencil is really helpful! I know this, but often skip the step and dive right into coding. Now that I'm getting into more complex code and writing a full app, it will be necessary to plan before coding! Today was good reminder that taking time to draw the project flow and write pseudocode for methods is not only fun but will improve the process and final product!


### Day 8: Thursday, January 10, 2019

**Today's Progress**: 
Coded basic methods for 3 main Classes in Music Library CLI app! 

**Thoughts:** 
I got through this in less than an hour, which is fast for me! My take-home is that I'm understanding better the object oriented concepts! I've worked kind of slowly so far in curriculum because object oriented coding is so new to me. in past I've worked in SPSS or SAS stats software coding data dictionaries, computing  variables, etc. but never with object orientation.
